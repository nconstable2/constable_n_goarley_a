			<h1>Modern Rap</h1>
			<p><strong>Modern Rap</strong> is the evolution of the genera, the natural combination of creative styles. Rap has changed to encompass the musical styles that have developed since it's assosiation with the post grunge scene of the early 2000s. Now, rap is more popular than it ever has been, even with saturation of the market with pop artists. As it has throughout it's history, rap has adapted by serving the tastes of current artists either through collaborations or by incorporating pop elements.</p>

			<p>That being said, 90s rap is for naval gazing hipster trash. Maybe it made sense to listen to at the time but I have no idea why anyone would subject themselves to it today. Literally all our problems today are a result of 90s rap. Seriously, just trace it back. All that super self-referencial stuff alienated working class billionaires who couldn't relate to the next generation's music taste. This probably led to them retreating from society to work on holodecks or something and they just forgot to adjust the cost of living for 40 years.</p>

			<p>case in point, Eminem fell ill in 2008. Clearly some animosity there. <strong>Coincidentally, also the year of the Subprime Mortgage crisis</strong></p>
